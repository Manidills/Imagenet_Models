# Imagenet_Models

ImageNet is a project which aims to provide a large image database for research purposes. It contains more than 14 million images which belong to more than 20,000 classes ( or synsets ). They also provide bounding box annotations for around 1 million images, which can be used in Object Localization tasks. It should be noted that they only provide urls of images and you need to download those images.

The winners of ILSVRC have been very generous in releasing their models to the open-source community. There are many models such as AlexNet, VGGNet, Inception, ResNet, Xception and many more which we can choose from, for our own task. Apart from the ILSVRC winners, many research groups also share their models which they have trained for similar tasks, e.g, MobileNet, SqueezeNet etc.

Here we imported all models and perform small prediction of image taken from internet.
